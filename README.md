K-Nearest Neighbor implementations for Java.  

Implementations include BK-Trees, Vantage Point Trees, and Symmetric Delete
Spelling Correction. BkTrees and VP Trees will work with any objects for which
integer-valued distance functions can be defined. 

Several String metrics (including Levenshtein, Damareau-Levenshtein, and Hamming distance) are defined in StringMetrics.java, and spatial metrics are defined in MoreMetrics.java.  

Use cases include KNN classification, spelling correction, map lookups with
fuzzy keys.
